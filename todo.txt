- add legends for dot maps

county pages to do
-------------------
X map should stretch to bounding box (could still use a little work, but mostly there/much better, adjust bbox svg container width)
- hover on dots on county map - include population, type
- add legend for map dots

misc
----
- correct A11y stuff
- tooltips
- endnotes (tooltips) - made superscript, need to add tooltip w/ info
- format bar chart labels (M, etc.)
